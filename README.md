# Machine Learning for Time Series Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive study and application of the paper titled "How to introduce expert feedback in one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection?" by J. Lesouple, C. Baudoin, M. Spigai, J.-Y. Tourneret. The objective is to explore the methodologies and implications of the introduction of an expert feedback in a classification task on time series.
